CODE BLOCKS(performance.html)

->What This Code Does (in Short)
This code builds a performance analysis web page for an BrainStroke Detection system. It visually displays model evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score) and a confusion matrix, using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap. It‚Äôs part of a larger web application (Flask suggested by {{url_for()}} syntax).

->High-Level Structure and Purpose of Each Part

| **Section**                 | **Purpose**                                                                                                                      |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `<head>`                    | Includes metadata, font imports, CSS stylesheets (local and external), and custom styles for layout and design consistency.      |
| `<style>` (inside `<head>`) | Contains embedded CSS for defining the site's theme (color palette, typography, layout effects, animations, and responsiveness). |
| `<body>`                    | Contains the visible content and layout for the **Performance Analysis** page.                                                   |
| `.site-navbar`              | Responsive top navigation bar with links to various sections like Home, Login, Preview, Performance Analysis, and Chart.         |
| `.hero`                     | Full-width header with a background image and heading (`Performance Analysis`) overlaid.                                         |
| `.performance-section`      | Displays **four metric cards** (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score) with animated values and stylized layout.                 |
| `.confusion-matrix`         | Displays a labeled image (confusion matrix) to show model classification performance visually.                                   |
| `<footer>`                  | Contains **About**, **Contact**, and **Resources** (linked to Drive docs), and copyright.                                        |
| `<script>` section          | Adds interactivity via jQuery, Bootstrap, AOS (animation), scroll effects, and metric value count-up animation.                  |
