CODE BLOCKS(login.html)

->What This Code Does (In Short):
It creates a visually appealing and responsive Login page using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It validates the login form on the client side, displays errors for empty fields, and redirects to the main application if login is successful (mock behavior).
