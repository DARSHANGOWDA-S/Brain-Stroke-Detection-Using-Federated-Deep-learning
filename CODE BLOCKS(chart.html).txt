CODE BLOCKS(chart.html)

This page provides a visually engaging and informative dashboard that helps users understand how different models perform in detecting BrainStroke disease. It is ideal for use in a web-based research portal or diagnostic tool presentation.

->What This Code Does (In Short):
*This HTML page visualizes the performance of different models used for BrainStroke disease detection. It presents:
*A pie chart showing the distribution of BrainStroke disease stages in the dataset.
*A bar chart comparing the accuracy of two AI models (CNN and InceptionV3).
*Styled statistics cards and a responsive layout for good user experience.

->High-Level Structure and Purpose of Each Part:
	Section					Purpose

1. <head>				Loads stylesheets, fonts, scripts (Google Charts), and includes custom CSS to define the look and feel of the page.
2. <script> (Pie Chart)			Loads and draws a 3D pie chart showing percentage distribution of BrainStroke disease classes.
3. <script> (Bar Chart)			Loads and draws a column chart comparing the accuracy of two deep learning models.
4. <body>				Contains the visual structure of the page including navbar, hero image, content sections, and footer.
5. hero section				Displays a banner with the title and a short subtitle.
6. chart-section (Distribution)		Shows percentage stats as cards and displays a pie chart of class distribution.
7. chart-section (Model Accuracy)	Compares InceptionV3 and CNN visually and numerically using cards and a bar chart.
8. footer				Gives brief info about the application and contact section (partially shown).

->Key Features:
1.🎨 Design & Style
*Uses Poppins and Playfair Display fonts for clean, modern typography.

2.📊 Charts (Google Charts)
Pie Chart:
*3D format for BrainStroke class breakdown.
*Color-coded segments (e.g., blue, pink, purple, orange).

Bar Chart:
*Displays accuracy of CNN (86.48%) vs. InceptionV3 (76.80%).
*Annotated with percentage values above bars.

3.📱 Responsive Layout
*Mobile-optimized with collapsible navbar.
*Cards and charts adjust layout using media queries for smaller devices.

4.🔄 Interactivity & Animations
